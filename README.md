# holbertonschool-monty

This repository contains the code for the **Monty project**, which is part of the curriculum at Holberton School.

# Description

**Monty** is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes. It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty byte codes files.

# Getting Started

To get started with the Monty project, clone this repository onto your local machine by running the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/<username>/monty.git`

# Usage

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the monty directory and run the following command to compile the program:

`gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty`

To run the program, use the following command:

`./monty <file_name>`

# Monty Byte Code Files

Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the .m extension. There is not more than one instruction per line. There can be any number of spaces before or after the opcode and its argument.

# Supported Opcodes

The following opcodes are supported by the Monty interpreter:

push
pall

# Examples
